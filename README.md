# Simpson's Paradox and Beta-Blocker Simulations

This repository contains two Python simulations: one illustrating **Simpson's Paradox** using kidney stone treatments, and the other simulating the effects of beta-blocker pills on blood pressure and patient outcomes. These codes showcase how different causal graphs and confounding variables can impact statistical outcomes.

### Simpson's Paradox Simulation

The first simulation models **Simpson's Paradox**, where two groups, defined by kidney stone size, receive different treatments (surgery or medication). Although one treatment appears better for both groups, the overall trend seems to reverse when the groups are combined due to the confounding variable (stone size). 

### Beta-Blocker Simulation

The second simulation explores the effect of a beta-blocker pill on patients' blood pressure and improvement probabilities. Here, patients' blood pressure is affected by whether or not they take the pill, and this influences their likelihood of improvement.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/elsisiem/simpsons-paradox-simulation.git

2. Run the simulations:

- python simpsons_paradox.py python beta_blocker.py


## Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. The code uses the `random` library, which is built-in with Python.

No additional libraries are required.
